# 🛒 Definitely-Not-Amazon™

> *"We have Amazon at home"* - Mom

A totally legitimate e-commerce platform that I definitely didn't make while procrastinating and learning JavaScript. Features include bouncing links, shapes you can "buy", and localStorage abuse!

## 🎨 What Even Is This?

This is my masterpiece of an Amazon clone where you can:
- ✨ Buy **premium geometric shapes** (Square, Circle, Triangle, Diamond)
- 🛍️ Add them to a cart (they're not real, but your excitement is!)
- 📦 Get them "delivered" to your home page
- 🎉 Experience the thrill of animated bouncing navigation links

Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no frameworks, no fancy build tools, just me vibing with the DOM.

## 🚀 Features

### The Shopping Experience
- **Index Page**: Welcome screen with epilepsy-inducing animated links
- **Check Out**: Pick your favorite shape with fancy custom radio buttons
- **Item Cart**: Review your collection of... shapes
- **Home**: See all your "delivered" items displayed as pixel art

### Technical "Innovations"
- Custom checkboxes and radio buttons (because default ones are boring)
- LocalStorage persistence (your shapes survive page refreshes!)
- Animated navigation links that bounce forever
- Gradient backgrounds everywhere (it's 2010 again baby!)
- Returning customer detection (welcome back!)

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Clone this masterpiece**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
   - No build process needed!
   - No npm install!
   - Just double-click and go!

3. **Start "shopping"**
   - Click "Check Out" to browse our extensive catalog of 4 shapes
   - Enable "Take An Item" checkbox to unlock the power of selection
   - Choose your shape wisely
   - Click "Place In Cart"
   - Go to "Item Cart" to admire your choices
   - Hit "Buy" to get them delivered
   - Check "Go To Home" to see your pixel art collection

## 🐛 Known "Features"

- Links might wrap weirdly on mobile (it adds character!)
- The scrolling was disabled for artistic reasons (now fixed on home page)
- Button hiding/showing is a feature, not a bug
- LocalStorage is our database (who needs MongoDB anyway?)
- The spelling of "itmesBuying" is intentional (it's called branding)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - For structure
- **CSS3** - For way too many gradients
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Pure, uncut, no dependencies
- **LocalStorage** - Our "database"
- **Love & Confusion** - The main ingredients

## 📝 What I Learned

- How to manipulate the DOM like a puppet master
- LocalStorage is both amazing and terrifying
- CSS animations can make anything look professional (almost)
- Custom form elements are harder than they look
- Naming things is hard (see: itmesBuying.html)
- Comments in code are important (I learned this the hard way)

## 🎯 Future "Improvements"

- [ ] Add more shapes (Hexagon? Octagon? The possibilities!)
- [ ] Implement a payment system (just kidding, it's free shapes)
- [ ] Fix the mobile wrapping issue (maybe)
- [ ] Add sound effects (annoying beeps for every click?)
- [ ] Dark mode (even more gradients!)
- [ ] Actually learn how to spell "items"
